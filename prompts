---------Not Interested Status Duration Logic-----------
// For calls marked as "Not Interested"
- Primary Duration Range (70% probability):
  • 6 seconds
  • 7 seconds
  • 8 seconds
  • 9 seconds

- Secondary Duration Range (30% probability):
  • 10 seconds
  • 11 seconds
  • 12 seconds

Implementation Details:
- System first checks if it's in the 70% primary or 30% secondary range
- Avoids using the same duration as the last call
- Has a 35% chance to reuse an older duration (but not the immediate last one)
- Stores the selected duration in notInterestedHistory


---------Interested Status Duration Logic-----------

// For calls marked as "Interested"
- Short Duration Range (for calls < 18 seconds):
  • 2 seconds (lowest probability)
  • 3 seconds (medium probability, appears 3 times)
  • 4 seconds (medium probability, appears 3 times)
  • 5 seconds (medium probability, appears 3 times)
  • 6 seconds (highest probability, appears 3 times)

- Medium Duration Range (for calls 18-30 seconds):
  • 7 seconds (highest probability, appears 4 times)
  • 8 seconds (high probability, appears 4 times)
  • 9 seconds (medium probability, appears 3 times)
  • 10 seconds (lower probability, appears 2 times)
  • 11 seconds (lower probability, appears 2 times)
  • 12 seconds (lowest probability, appears once)

Implementation Details:
- System first determines if the call falls in short or medium range
- Uses weighted random selection to pick duration
- Maintains separate histories for short and medium durations
- For calls > 30 seconds, subtracts 28 seconds from actual duration

---------Callback Status Duration Logic-----------
// For calls marked as "Callback"
Duration Categories:
1. Short Duration (< 18 seconds):
   • Uses same weights as Interested status short duration
   • [2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]

2. Medium Duration (18-30 seconds):
   • Uses same weights as Interested status medium duration
   • [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12]

3. Long Duration (> 30 seconds):
   • Subtracts 28 seconds from actual duration

Implementation Details:
- Maintains separate histories for callback durations
- Prevents consecutive identical durations
- Uses weighted random selection within each range

----new button----
now create a 3. button when that button is clicked  then it should automatically fills email as telecaller1@gmail.com and password as : telecaller@123 & these email and password is already set in the firebase authentication and it should opens dialpad.html of telecaller3@gmail.com and password as : telecaller@123

----------telecaller and manager login prompts ----------
Listen to me very carefully focus more on this update with marketing manager buttons clicked the login details With is appearing I need the same login details Pop up when I click telecaller button as well . when telecaller enters email: telecaller1@gmail.com password : telecaller@123 the dial pad should open And every call made on the dialpad .html(script code is in the same file) should store on firebase realtimedatabase with email: telecaller1@gmail.com and when marketing manager enters email: admin1@gmail.com & password: admin@123 it should fetch only calls made by telecaller with email: telecaller1@gmail.com from firebase realtime database on maindashboard.html (script code is linked to script.js). Now case 2 : when telecaller enters email: telecaller2@gmail.com password : telecaller@123 the dial pad should open And every call made on the dialpad .html(script code is in the same file) should store on firebase realtimedatabase with email: telecaller2@gmail.com and when marketing manager enters email: admin2@gmail.com & password: admin@123 it should fetch only calls made by telecaller with email: telecaller2@gmail.com from firebase realtime database on maindashboard.html (script code is linked to script.js).

 





You have failed to understand when I am entering admin1@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch Calls made by telecaller1@gmail.com Call details only from firebase realtime database similarly when I enter admin2@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch Calls made by telecaller2@gmail.com Call details only from firebase realtime database on maindashboard.html (script is linked to script.js) on firebase Real time database it is storing as the following  -O8fQiGl9sYLyi8KSZSd

:
"telecaller1@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display on maindashboard.html








similarly when I enter admin1@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller1@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display monthly calls on monthly_calls.html and today calls on  today_calls.html case2: when I enter admin2@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller2@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display monthly calls on monthly_calls.html and today calls on  today_calls.html


-------firebase login----------
On index.html Instead of storing the Email ID and password locality I have an idea ----2nd---I have created firebase authentication email password in that I have added the email ids and passwords for telecaller the login credientials are telecaller1@gmail.com and password is telecaller@123 and telecaller2@gmail.com and password is telecaller@123 and for marketing manager admin1@gmail.com and password is admin@123 and admin2@gmail.com and password is admin@123 . Keep everything as it is just whenever the password username and passwords are being entered cheque whether the user name and password are from Firebase credentials I mean firebase authentication or not if they are from firebase authentication allow the user then otherwise dont allow




----3rd----similarly when I enter admin1@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller1@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display on  today calls on  today_calls.html when calender date is selected case2: when I enter admin2@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller2@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display today calls on  today_calls.htmlwhen date in the calender is selected and clicked on submit




1st-----------------imp--------------
listen to me very carefully i will be adding more telecallers and marketing manager email ids like telecaller3@gmail.com telecaller4@gmail.com etc... with password : telecaller@123 and more marketing manager email ids like admin3@gmail.com admin4@gmail.com etc... with password : admin@123 etc.... i will be initializing the email and passwords on fire base authentication and the pattern is telecaller3@gmail.com data will be only accessed by the marketing manager email ids like admin3@gmail.com similarly telecaller4@gmail.com data will be only accessed by the marketing manager email ids like admin4@gmail.com where should i make code changes in index.html, UI of maindashboard.html(script is linked to script.js) , script.js, monthly_calls.html, today_calls.html . tell me in detail where exactly do i need to add things on each file so that when ever i want i can add the telecaller email ids and marketing manager email ids in the code of each file mentioned above . NOTE : i will be creating the telecaller email ids and passwords and marketing manager email ids and passwords on firebase authentication 
The pattern telecallerX@gmail.com will be associated with adminX@gmail.com, where X is any number. 


maindashboard.html script is linked to script.js , monthly_calls.html ,today_calls.html make necessary changes in all the files mentioned above & the data should be fetched and displayed on maindashboard.html, monthly_calls.html, today_calls.html 


-------- important prompts----------
----1st----
Dont change any of the existing Code just focus on implementing the Instructed changes Listen to me very carefully on index.html When I click on telecaller button After entering the Telecaller login details of The pattern telecallerX@gmail.com where X is any number . It is Checking firebase authentication whether the entered email id and password matching with authentication email id password or not if it is matching it is allowing me to access dialpad.html there is no problem up to here. now focus on here, If Telecaller enters correct email id and password and clicks on submit then Capture That email id from login details & send it to dialpad.html . Now The dialpad.html Should capture that email id from index.html with the name of telecallerEmail: & the calls with Storing on firebase real time database by this dialpad.html based on the status pop up card buttons that Every call must be stored on firebase real time database with captured telecallerEmail from index.html .



----2nd----
I appreciate you for this you have done a great job now the second update is Listen to me very very carefully If the number is dialled by the user on dialpad.html and clicked on call button then initiate the call & cheque whether that number already existed under the status : "not interested " or "unanswered "or "callback" If the dialled number is found under the above status Delete that number from firebase real time database and update it with new status based on the pop up cards buttons clicked by the user . make sure it saves properly with telecallerEmail On firebase Realtime database


----3rd---- 
Perfect I appreciate you so much for that now the third update is: If the dialled number is found under "interested " status of firebase realtime database after 5 seconds show the pop up card of Was The Call Lifted? And click on Lifted Then update the date and time  (Don't create separate data base firebase real time database  If lifted Just change the date and time of the existing record of that number under interested status ) if clicked on Not Lifted Then don't make any changes just clear the display screen of dialpad html and close the popup


----4th----
 You're continuously Making mistakes please focus: When clicked on lifted then I'm getting on console like this : New call data successfully recorded in Firebase: {number: '1111122222', status: 'Interested', notes: 'Call was lifted', duration: '0:08', dateTime: '11/10/24 19:41', …}
dialpad.html:590 Updated existing Interested call for 1111122222 . This means new call data is successfully again recorded in Firebase this should not happen only date time and duration should be updated with existing interested count

----5th----
Now the update i want is On maindashboard.html after Capturing the email id as Admin email captured in maindashboard.html: admin1@gmail.com on console . It should only fetch the 
telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller1@gmail.com" details from firebase realtime datebase and display on the UI of maindashboard.html , if admin2@gmail.com is captured then It should only fetch the 
telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller2@gmail.com" details from firebase realtime datebase, if admin3@gmail.com is captured then It should only fetch the 
telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller3@gmail.com" details from firebase realtime datebase. The maindashboard.html file is linked to script.js make sure that this script.js file and maindashboard.html file are properly interlinked make required changes on both files . I'm strictly instructing you don't change any of the existing code just implement the instructed features only . I am again saying you if admin2@gmail.com is captured then It should only fetch the 
telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller2@gmail.com" and if if admin1@gmail.com is captured then It should only fetch the 
telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller1@gmail.com" From Firebase Real Time database and it should only display the fetched car details on the ui of maindashboard.html
